# Bitcoin Public Key/Address Extractor

This Python script connects to a locally running Bitcoin (or compatible) node, scans a specified range of blocks, and extracts public keys found within transactions along with their corresponding P2PKH addresses.

## Features

*   **Node Connection**: Connects to a local Bitcoin node via JSON-RPC.
*   **Block Scanning**: Scans blocks within a specified height range.
*   **Data Extraction**: Extracts public keys from transactions (found in `scriptSig` and P2PK outputs).
*   **Address Conversion**: Converts the extracted public keys into their corresponding P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash) Bitcoin addresses.
*   **Result Saving**: Saves the unique `PublicKey: Address` pairs to a specified output file.
*   **Error Handling**: Includes basic RPC connection retry logic and prompts the user for manual reconnection attempts after repeated failures.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3**: Python 3.x must be installed.
2.  **Running Node**: A locally running Bitcoin Core node (or a compatible one) with RPC service enabled.
3.  **RPC Credentials**: The RPC username and password for your node.

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to modify the following constants at the beginning of the rpc_config.json script to match the configuration of your node. If there is no password, please generate it yourself in the rpcauth.py script in bitcoin/share/rpcauth. It is usually the same as the wallet password and name. :
```python
{
  "rpc_host": "127.0.0.1",
  "rpc_port": 8332,
  "rpc_user": "Your_RPC_Username",
  "rpc_password": "Your_RPC_Password",
  "num_workers": 4
}

```

Note: Hard-coding the RPC password directly into the script will bring certain security risks. Please test it with an empty wallet with no balance. Ensure the script file has appropriate access permissions.

# Install Dependencies
This script requires the requests and base58 libraries. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install requests
```

Alternatively, save the following as a requirements.txt file:
```
requests
```

Txt
Then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# How to Run

Run the script using the following command format:
```
python3 extract_data.py <start_block_height> <end_block_height> <output_filename>
```

Parameters:

<start_block_height>: The block height (integer) where you want to start scanning.

<end_block_height>: The block height (integer) where you want to end scanning (inclusive).

<output_filename>: The name of the text file to save the extracted results (e.g., output_pairs.txt).

Example:

Scan blocks from 100000 to 100100 (inclusive) and save the results to output_pairs.txt:
```
python3 extract_data.py 100000 100100 output_pairs.txt
```

If the script loses connection to the node during execution, it will attempt to reconnect a few times. If it still fails, it will prompt you to press 'P' to manually trigger a reconnection attempt.

# Output File Format
The output file will contain multiple lines, each with the following format:

<Hexadecimal PublicKey>: <Corresponding Bitcoin Address>

# Since public keys can generate addresses of multiple currencies, if you need all the public keys, please go to my other library, search and extract the public keys with surplus by yourself.
